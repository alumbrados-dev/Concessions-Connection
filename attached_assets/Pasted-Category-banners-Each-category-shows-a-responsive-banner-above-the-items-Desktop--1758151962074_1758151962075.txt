Category banners

    * Each category shows a responsive banner above the items:
        * Desktop: <Category>_web.png (ACTIVE folder)

        * Mobile: <Category>_mobile.png (ACTIVE folder)
    * If a banner image fails to load, it is hidden automatically.

One-page layout overview

    * Single-page layout with a hero at top, then About Us, then Menu sections, then a Local Events stub, then a bottom-right persistent warning image (not
floating).
    * Hero:
        * 1Connect4 image pinned on the far left (desktop), vertically centered

        * Hamburger menu button (three horizontal bars) pinned on the far right (desktop), clearly visible (high z-index)

        * Center hero image (1Concessions.png)

        * Just below hero, 1Linking.png centered (hero subtitle image)
    * Hamburger menu (desktop & mobile):
        * About App (modal with Download popup; About App shows UX/UI Design @alumbrados.dev)

        * Menu (smooth scroll to the Menu section)

        * Local Events (navigates to /events)

        * Admin (navigates to /admin)

        * “Who We Are” is intentionally removed from the menu, but the About Us section remains on the page (by your request).
    * About Us section:
        * Body copy describing Concessions Connection

        * Quoted tagline: “…Linking Families through tastes and experience.”

        * “Our Difference” bullet list

        * “Join the Connection” paragraph

        * Hours of Operation (Tuesday–Sunday, 11 AM–8 PM; configured later by Admin)

        * GPS card:

            * Shows “We are currently offline” if GPS is disabled


            * Shows “Current Location: <text>” if enabled and a location is set


            * “Location temporarily unavailable” if enabled but no string is present

        * Note: GPS is intentionally in About Us, not in Events (per your plan)
    * Local Events (separate page /events):
        * Clean scaffold “Local Events – Coming Soon”

        * This is a separate route ready for your future geo-fencing + Google APIs (DMV/Baltimore, etc.)
    * Warning image:
        * Persistent, non-floating image at the bottom-right of the page (larger size, no border)
    * Styling:
        * Card-based sections with rounded corners and subtle shadows

        * Deep orange as the accent color (headers, prices, buttons)

        * Clean, accessible typography and spacing
