            * Quantity badge: displays the current count


            * “+” button: increments quantity by 1 (disabled if item is marked unavailable)
    * Quantity state is stored in-memory while you stay on the page (no backend or cart persistence yet).
    * If an item is marked unavailable, the control disables and a small “Currently Unavailable” badge appears.
